# IraAI Virtual Girlfriend
**IraAI** is a Python-based virtual AI girlfriend designed for fun, casual conversations, and engaging interactions. With this program, you can chat with an AI-powered virtual personality and receive dynamic responses to your messages.

## Features
- Chat with IraAI using natural language.
- Real-time streaming responses for a smooth conversation experience.
- AI reactions including "like," "love," and "haha."

## How It Works
IraAI interacts with an API to simulate a virtual girlfriend experience. You provide your **KEY** and **REFRESH_TOKEN**, and the program sends your queries to the API to receive responses.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.
- The `requests` library installed. You can install it using:
```bash
pip install requests
```
- Your personal KEY and REFRESH_TOKEN for authentication.

## Installation
- Clone or download the repository.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Getting Your KEY and REFRESH_TOKEN

To use the IraAI class, you'll need your **KEY** and **REFRESH_TOKEN**. Follow the steps below to retrieve them:
```
1. Log in to your account on the IraAI platform (https://ira.rumik.ai/).
2. Open the browser's developer tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on most browsers).
3. Navigate to the **Network** tab.
4. Look for API requests (https://securetoken.googleapis.com/v1/token?key=).
5. Copy the `KEY` and `REFRESH_TOKEN` from the request payload.
```

Refer to the image below for detailed instructions:

## Usage
- Start chatting with IraAI:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
  IraAI = IraAI()
  response = IraAI.chat("Hello, Ira!")
  print(response)
```

## Error Handling
The program includes robust error handling:

- If the KEY and REFRESH_TOKEN is invalid or expired, you'll see a clear error message:
  - Token expired and in few moments it will Generating a new one automatically.
- If the request fails, the error will be displayed:
  - Request failed: Connection timed out.

## Notes
- Ensure your KEY and REFRESH_TOKEN is valid to avoid authentication errors.
- API response time depends on your network speed and server availability.
