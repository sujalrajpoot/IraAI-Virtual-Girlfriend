# RumikaAI Virtual Girlfriend
**RumikaAI** is a Python-based virtual AI girlfriend designed for fun, casual conversations, and engaging interactions. With this program, you can chat with an AI-powered virtual personality and receive dynamic responses to your messages.

## Features
- Chat with RumikaAI using natural language.
- Real-time streaming responses for a smooth conversation experience.
- AI reactions including "like," "love," and "haha."
- Customizable for different use cases by integrating your own access tokens and Firebase IDs.

## How It Works
RumikaAI interacts with an API to simulate a virtual girlfriend experience. You provide your **access token** and **Firebase ID**, and the program sends your queries to the API to receive responses.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.
- The `requests` library installed. You can install it using:
```bash
pip install requests
```
- Your personal access token and Firebase ID for authentication.

## Installation
- Clone or download the repository.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Getting Your Access Token and Firebase ID

To use the RumikaAI class, you'll need your **access_token** and **Firebase ID**. Follow the steps below to retrieve them:
```
1. Log in to your account on the RumikaAI platform.
2. Open the browser's developer tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on most browsers).
3. Navigate to the **Network** tab.
4. Look for API requests (messages) containing the `Authorization` header for your `access_token`.
5. Copy the `Firebase ID` from the request payload.
```

Refer to the image below for detailed instructions:

## Usage
- Start chatting with RumikaAI:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
  access_token = "your_access_token_here"
  firebaseId = "your_firebase_id_here"
  rumika = RumikaAI(access_token, firebaseId)
  response = rumika.chat("Hello, Rumika!")
  print(response)
```

## Error Handling
The program includes robust error handling:

- If the access token is invalid or expired, you'll see a clear error message:
  - Token expired.
- If the request fails, the error will be displayed:
  - Request failed: Connection timed out.

## Notes
- Ensure your access token is valid to avoid authentication errors.
- API response time depends on your network speed and server availability.
